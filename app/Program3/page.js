            <h2>SCHOOLS</h2>
            <p>The Transform Lives program provides schoolchildren access to drinking water, better sanitation facilities, a learning-conducive school environment, and digital and life skills awareness trainings. Parents, teachers, and children are encouraged to increase enrollment and reduce dropouts in rural government schools, especially for girl children. School Management Committees (SMCs) are provided with support and training to build their capacities for improved and sustained functioning of the school.</p>
            <p>THE NEED
A better school environment can ensure a brighter future, especially for girl
children, because education has the power to transform an individual, then a
family, society, and ultimately the nation and the world.

By providing safe infrastructure, clean drinking water, toilet facilities, life skills, and digital awareness sessions, school enrollment and retention have increased, leading to positive outcomes.</p>
