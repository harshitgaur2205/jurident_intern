            <h2>AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT</h2>
                <p>Agriculture Development Program promotes sustainable livelihoods in India by building capacities of farmers, including women farmers, on improved agricultural practices and new technologies that increase crop yields, conserve water, and improve soil fertility. The team works with small-holder and marginal farmers in rain-fed and irrigated areas to facilitate adoption of advanced and sustainable agricultural practices that include soil health management, climate-smart interventions, crop production management, input-use efficiency, small farm mechanization, water-efficient irrigation techniques, horticultural development, livestock management, and the use of information and communication technology (ICT) in agriculture.</p>
                <p>Use of appropriate machines and modern technology in agriculture has the potential to address and overcome challenges such as poverty, resource scarcity, climate change, hunger, and malnutrition. Introducing farm mechanization in agriculture saves time and labor costs, decreases input cost, reduces the risk of weather and labor uncertainties, increases the quality and quantity of produce, and improves return over investment and farm income over time.

The Agriculture Development Program increases the penetration of mechanization among small and marginal farmers by providing farm machines to enterprising farmers at subsidized rates. Farmers contribute to the cost of the machinery, which instills in them a sense of ownership as well as entrepreneurship. The program trains farmers to operate and maintain the machines and subsequently earn an extra livelihood by renting these machines to other farmers.</p>
